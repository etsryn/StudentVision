```

### 🎨 **Frontend Code Editor (React + Monaco Editor)**
```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import Editor from "@monaco-editor/react";
import axios from "axios";

function CodeCell() {
  const [code, setCode] = useState("x = 5\nprint(x + 10)");
  const [output, setOutput] = useState("");

  async function runCode() {
    try {
      const response = await axios.post("http://localhost:5000/execute", { code });
      setOutput(response.data.output || response.data.error);
    } catch (error) {
      setOutput("Error executing code.");
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Editor height="300px" defaultLanguage="python" value={code} onChange={setCode} />
      <button onClick={runCode}>Run</button>
      <pre>{output}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}

export default CodeCell;
```
